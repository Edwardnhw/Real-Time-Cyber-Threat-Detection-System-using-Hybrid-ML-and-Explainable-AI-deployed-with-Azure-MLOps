# Cybersecurity Threat Detection using Hybrid ML and Azure MLOps

This project implements a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for banking cybersecurity environments. It combines **unsupervised anomaly detection** and **supervised classification** models, deployed with full MLOps lifecycle automation using **Azure Machine Learning** and other Azure services.

## üîç Project Overview

Financial institutions face continuous threats, including:
- Brute-force attacks
- Credential stuffing
- Insider threats
- Lateral movement and zero-day exploits

This system learns both **known** and **unknown** threat behaviors using structured network and user behavior data.

## üéØ Objectives

- Build and deploy an ML-powered IDS using supervised and unsupervised learning
- Detect zero-day anomalies and known attack patterns
- Provide explainable alerts to support SOC (Security Operations Center) analysts
- Enable full CI/CD automation using Azure DevOps and Azure ML Pipelines
- Ensure secure, compliant data handling using Azure-native governance tools

## üß† ML Tasks & Models

### Anomaly Detection (Unsupervised)
- **Goal**: Detect unknown or novel threats
- **Algorithms**: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders
- **Use Cases**: Zero-day exploits, insider threats

### Binary Classification (Supervised)
- **Goal**: Detect known threats using labeled data
- **Algorithms**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression
- **Use Cases**: Brute-force login attempts, known malicious IP usage

### Explainability
- **Tools**: SHAP
- **Integration**: Explanation included in inference pipeline
